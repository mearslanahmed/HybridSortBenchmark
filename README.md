# Hybrid MergeSort Benchmark


## Overview

This project implements a **Hybrid MergeSort** algorithm in Java.  
The algorithm switches to **Insertion Sort** when subarray size â‰¤ threshold `s`.  
It benchmarks performance for various `s` values and plots how runtime changes.

---

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later (JDK)
- Python 3 (only for plotting)
- `matplotlib` (for the graph)

---

## How to Run

### **1. Compile**

```bash
javac HybridSortBenchmark.java
```

### **2. Run**

```bash
java -Xmx4g HybridSortBenchmark <ArraySize> <SamplePoints>
```

- Examples:
- Run with auto-estimated array size

```bash
java -Xmx4g HybridSortBenchmark
```

- Run with fixed array size 20000 and 40 sample points

```bash
java -Xmx4g HybridSortBenchmark 20000 40
```

- This will:

  - Create a random integer array of given size.

  - Run Hybrid MergeSort for multiple s thresholds.

  - Write results in results.csv.

## Setting Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To keep dependencies isolated, please create and activate a virtual environment before installing packages.

### For Windows

- Run these command one by one in terminal of vs code

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### For macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Once activated, your terminal will show (venv) at the start of the line.

Now move on to the Plotting part...

## Plotting the Graph

1. First install dependecies with this command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Then run this command

```bash
python plot_results.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Graph Results
